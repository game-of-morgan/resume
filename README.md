## Check out the app (my bio)

I've written this Github page as a card style, to the point bio on my professional experience and interests. [Take a look!](https://game-of-morgan.github.io/resume/)

## This project

This is a small React app with a fun little "StaticTypewriter" component I wrote to help me create a unique experience for the user. I hope you enjoy!
